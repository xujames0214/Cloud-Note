# Cloud-Note
This is a web-based Notebook System built with Spring MVC and MyBatis framework when I studied in Tarena International, Inc.
The project contains both the front-end and back-end of a website. (The Notebook System is actually a website which can be accessed through a browser.)
To run this project, you need to start a Apache Tomcat server and put the project on this server.
You can create, modify, delete your own notebooks and notes in this system. All information about these notes is stored in a MySQL database through MyBatis framework.
